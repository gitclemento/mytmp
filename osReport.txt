i) processes
	- process concept
		- What is a process
		- process state (new, running, waiting, ready, terminated)
		- process control block (PCB)
	- process scheduling
		- process scheduling queues (job, ready, device, etc.)
		- types of schedulers (long-term, medium-term, short-term)
	- operations on processes
		- create
		- destroy
		- suspend
		- resume
		- change priority
		- block
		- wakeup
		- dispatch
		- enable communication
	- threads
	- interprocess communication (IPC)
		- message system
		- logical vs. physical IPC
		- buffering

ii) CPU scheduling
	- basic scheduling
		- goals: multi-programming, maximize CPU utilization, manage process cycles
		- preemptive vs nonpreemptive scheduling
	- scheduling criteria
		- CPU utilization (max)
		- throughput (max)
		- turnaround time (min)
		- waiting time (min)
		- response time (min)
		- priority
	- scheduling algorithms
		- First-come, first serve (FIFO)
		- Round robin (RR)
		- Shortest-job-first (SJR)
			- shortest-remaining-time-first (SRTF)
		- Priority scheduling
